See [This Blog Post](http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2012/11/announcing-google-drive-site-publishing.html) where I discovered the trick.

You can host a web page on google drive now. You can even host relative assets, etc and google drive does a good job of finding them.

One stumbling point I had: If you need assets, you have to use the root **folder's** long identifying string. Not the specific HTML file's string.

### Hosting solution for markdown presentations?

I'd love a way to use markdown to generate HTML presentations. If I were to use a markdown-generated HTML presentation, I'd probably want to host it somewhere. Probably exactly where I edit it in the first place. In my google drive!

### I took a shot at it

So I hosted a folder of "presentations" I may potentially give: [Presentations on Google Drive](https://googledrive.com/host/0B4pzqThqXEKfdlVkSlBSaVNwQkE/)

### Hesitations

1. Image embedding is manual by filename - ick. That's not going away either.
2. Remark.js default styling is horrible. I tried to emulate reveal.js but it's hard.
