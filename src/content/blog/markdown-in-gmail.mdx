## [Markdown Here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here) is a browser extension.

### Handy!

I send weekly newsletters, and this is a great way to style them with

1. Very basic, likely-compatible HTML.
2. A nice plaintext fallback.

In fact, we already send email with out our 'headers' prepended with `#` just out of habit. The simplest transition!

### Recent History

It looks like `adam-p` started working on it May 2012 (just ~6 months ago) but it's already quite stable and usable by my standards :)

I `code_swarm`ed his project, and he's gone through a couple of programming spurts already, every couple months. It's a pretty active project as they go. `adam-p` is keeping up with browser updates admirably :) I'm comfortable using this in at least the short-term, hopefully for longer!

### One drawback - reverting loses changes

There's one drawback that'll be hard to get used to. If I edit the HTML version and then revert, the changes are lost. To the author's credit, [he notes that](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here#notes-and-miscellaneous). And he's brainstormed possible solutions already.

I'm not sure the `HTML => md` options in javascript are mature enough for this venture, but my fingers are crossed!

### Needs better default CSS

It has decent default styling (based off of Mou.app?), but it's not quiite optimized for email.

My first tweak: I'm not happy with the `<li>` padding/margin, so I made it much smaller.

I'll probably go through tweaking it here and there for a while. Once I'm comfortable maybe I'll suggest improvements to the default :D

## An example from an actual email we've sent

The original email is (almost) completely raw; how we sent it anyway. The conversion is certainly easier to read. And we're not even using any of markdown's features except headers.

## Conclusion

I'm excited to use markdown in one more place! Away with GUI formatting!
