## Really liking Jekyll

Jekyll works great for so many things! In particular:

- I enjoy hosting my blog and deploying using git
- I realllly like writing using markdown :)
- I'm totally comfortable modifying CSS, and I can even do that in my favorite text editor VIM!

But I miss:

- Tumblr-style sharing and reblogging. Tumblr doesn't really have a community of code-posts anyway though.

## I Want Github-Flavored CodeBlocks

I really want to write github-style code blocks, so I tried using this plugin

```
https://github.com/nono/Jekyll-plugins
```

And it worked great locally! But I couldn't get it to run on github pages. The end. :/

## Debugging

If you ever have bad syntax, jekyll won't compile anything. No changes. And it won't even tell you why unless you ask.

If you say please it'll tell you - this line does it:

```
jekyll --no-server --no-auto
```
