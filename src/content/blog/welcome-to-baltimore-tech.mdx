Welcome to Baltimore!! 🎉

## Becoming Baltimore

There are really two steps to Becoming Baltimore:

1. 🦀 consume a gallon of Old Bay seasoning
2. 👋🏻 getting connected to the community

In this post I'll help you with step 2, **getting connected to the community** 🙂

## Why Get Connected?

You might want to get more connected for bunch of reasons:

- Make **friends** with people with similar interests (tech friends!)
- Find **jobs** (or hiring candidates)
- **Learn** things; keep your skills current
- Find **projects** to contribute to

### Big Idea: Relationships Over Transactions

Have you ever had someone approach you with an IMMEDIATE ask -- like "JOB PLEASE!!"? Like LinkedIn recruiters lol -- it is not endearing!

People who join a community trying to "take" immediately, without forming relationships or "giving" to the group won't make many friends OR find many jobs (etc). If you instead focus on talking to people as people, you'll have a much better chance at friendship and jobs -- both! I say it this way:

> Warm relationships, not cold transactions!

## Where to Meet People?

Where can you meet people? There are a bunch of ways!

- In-person local **meetups**
- In-person local **conferences**
- **Chatting online** (Slack, etc)
- **One on one** "coffee chats"

## Local Meetups

We have a ton of local meetups! Here's a list I've collected so far:

- [Baltimore Code and Coffee](https://www.meetup.com/baltimore-code-and-coffee/)
- [Syntax R Us](https://www.meetup.com/syntax-r-us/)
- [Code for Baltimore](https://www.meetup.com/code-for-baltimore/)
- [Charm City JS](https://www.meetup.com/charmcityjs/)
- [DevOps Columbia](https://www.meetup.com/devops-columbia/)
- [Baltimore UX (BUX)](https://www.meetup.com/baltimore-ux-meetup/)
- [DataWorks](https://www.meetup.com/dataworks)
- [Baltimore Tech Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Tech/)

And I even made a mega-calendar for it using my friend Abe's tool [Calmerge](https://calmerge.habet.dev/).

- You can get this into your own calendar by adding it "From URL" using this calendar feed url: `https://calmerge.habet.dev/calendars/ed8657a8-2124-4584-ba4b-1673c72db24e.ical`
- Note: past events get pruned, but future ones show up here.
- Know about some meetups (with an ical feed) that aren't here yet? [Let me know](/contact)!

## Local Conferences

These are "active" ones:

- [DevOpsDays Baltimore](https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-baltimore/welcome/) in May
- [DAX Conference (Data, Analytics, Exploration)](https://daxconf.org/) in June

And some "inactive" ones we've had in the past:

- [BohConf](http://bohconf.com/) (none planned)
- [TEDxBaltimore](https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/15788) (none planned)

## Online Chat (Slack)

To meet people, you have to go where the people are! Online, that's [Baltimore Tech Slack](http://baltimoretechslack.com/) -- our general tech Slack for the area. There's a lot of great discussion in here, including:

- Local events in <u>#meetups-and-events</u>
- Meet up during the workday by <u>#coworking</u> with people (like: work next to each other then grab lunch, etc)
- Jobs (including many that don't make it to job boards!) in <u>#jobs</u>
- Chat with people who share an interest like <u>#javascript</u> or <u>#ux</u> in topic channels ilke those
- Chat with people who also go to meetup groups like Baltimore Code and Coffee, DevOps Columbia

## One on One Chats

People are generally very open to meeting people and welcoming folks to the community! More than you might expect (as long as you aren't trying to get something out of them).

Most people (more than half!) would be totally down to have an informal 30min chat with someone who just moved to the area.

Here's an example of a "cold reach-out" I might do on Slack:

> Hi! I just moved to Baltimore from CT, and I'm trying to meet more people here. I noticed you were really friendly on this Slack in the #javascript channel and I wanted to reach out to say hi!
>
> If you have time in the next week or two I'd love to chat with you on a video call :)

And then sometimes mid-conversation I'll ask for **more connections**, something like

> I'm trying to find "my people" here. I'm queer and I've been doing javascript for a few years. Do you know of any individuals or groups I might want to meet?

Where can you find people to have these one on one chats with?

- Meet them in person and exchange contact information
- Meet them on Slack, LinkedIn, etc

## Next Steps

So, what's your plan? 🙂

I suggest:

1. **Slack**: Join [Baltimore Tech Slack](https://www.baltimoretechslack.com) and say hello there.
2. **Meetup**: Find a Meetup group above that sounds interesting to you and go to their next event (If you have trouble choosing, maybe try Code and Coffee!)
3. **One on ones**: Reach out to 3 people this week to have one on one chats with.
